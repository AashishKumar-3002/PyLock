# PyLock

PyLock is a simple Python script that enhances laptop security by automatically locking the screen when closed eyes are detected through computer vision. This project supports Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms, providing a cross-platform solution for users concerned about privacy and security.

## Usage

1. Install Python and required libraries (OpenCV).
2. Ensure your platform-specific requirements are met.
3. Run the script using Python: `python pylock.py`.
4. The script continuously monitors your face, locking the laptop if it detects closed eyes or an absent face.

Feel free to customize the script to suit your needs or integrate it with other security measures. Stay vigilant and secure with PyLock!
